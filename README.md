# MIT_EVC
Simulations that formalize predictions of Motivational Intensity Theory (MIT) in terms of Expected Value of Control (EVC) Theory

The following plots are available:

Expected value of control (EVC) as a function of task difficulty: 
plotEVC.m

Control signal intensity (effort) as a function of expected task difficulty: 
plotTaskDifficulty.m

Maximum control signal intensity (success importance) as a function of the value associated with a primary task: 
plotMaxSignal_ValueTask1.m

Maximum tolerable difficulty as a function of the value associated with an alternative task: 
plotAvoidancePoint_ValueTask2.m

Maximum control signal intensity (success importance) as a function of the cost of control:
plotMaxSignal_controlCostTask1.m

Maximum tolerable difficulty as a function of the cost of control:
plotAvoidancePoint_controlCostTask1.m
